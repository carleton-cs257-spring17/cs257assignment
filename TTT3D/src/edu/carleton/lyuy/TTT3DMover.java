/**
 * TTT3DMover's job is to analyze a TTT3DBoard and make choices about what move
 * a player should make next. A TT3DMover object could be used as a key component
 * of the "AI" player in a full-blown 3D tic-tac-toe application.
 * <p>
 * In phase 3 of this assignment, you'll implement the methods stubbed and
 * documented below. In phase 2 (which comes before phase 3, as you might guess),
 * you'll create a JUnit TTT3DMoverTest class with a suitably rich collection of
 * unit tests for the public methods below.
