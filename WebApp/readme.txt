1. Chrome has bugs, Safari works well. But Safari does not support html date input, you need to type the date by yourself.

2. Allow pop-ups in Chrome in order to enable Google calendar page to show up. Add extension Allow-Control-Allow-Origin to make API work properly. Disable cross-origin restrictions when using Safari.

3. It might take a few seconds for events to show up. It does not often act like that, but there is a fairly high chance that it would happen. Please use shift+command+r to refresh the page if in Chrome.
